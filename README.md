# Suicidal Ideation Detection Using NLP & Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting suicidal ideation from social media posts using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). The goal is to create an intelligent system that can flag potentially suicidal content, aiding mental health intervention and support efforts.

# Overview

With the growing use of social media, individuals often express distress or suicidal thoughts online. This project aims to use AI to identify such posts in real time by classifying text data into *suicidal* or *non-suicidal* categories.


# Features

- Automated social media data scraping (via UiPath)
- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization)
- Text vectorization (TF-IDF, Word2Vec)
- ML & DL models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, LSTM, CNN
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Deployable via Flask/Streamlit for real-time usage


# Tech Stack

- Languages: Python
- Libraries: 
  - NLP: NLTK, SpaCy
  - ML/DL: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
  - Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Automation: UiPath (for scraping social media posts)
- Frontend (optional): Streamlit / Flask

# Future Work

Add multi-language support (e.g., Hindi, Telugu).
Integrate emotion classification and sentiment scoring.
Improve real-time detection with Transformer models like BERT.
Connect with helpline APIs for emergency response.
